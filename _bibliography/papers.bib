  abstract={Smart cameras have been increasingly deployed in smart homes for remote monitoring and enhancing home security. However, extensive recent research has uncovered potential user privacy threats associated with popular commercial camera systems. Some manufacture design of these commercial camera systems usually requires smart camera users to relinquish their control of camera recorded data. For instance, these cameras often upload camera recordings to their cloud servers to enable advanced data analysis for camera app services. To facilitate enhanced camera services, the data may be further shared with on-path vendors, third parties of manufacturers, and cloud providers, potentially allowing them to access video footage or image captures without users' awareness or meaningful consent. To address this problem, we design a new smart camera system-PACAS that enables people to regain the control of their data while still retaining access to regular camera services. We evaluate PACAS using multiple camera video footage traces and on multiple real-world camera prototypes. We show that PACAS can achieve the performance of 0.5 second living streaming latency at a frame rate of 30 fps and a resolution of 240x320 on average. PACAS offers compelling evidence that smart camera systems can deliver on-device modern capabilities comparable to those provided by current commercial systems, all while upholding user privacy.}

      abstract={The Internet traffic data produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are collected by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and device manufacturers, and often shared with their third parties to maintain and enhance user services. Unfortunately, on-path adversaries could infer and fingerprint users' sensitive privacy information such as occupancy and user activities by analyzing these network traffic traces. While there's a growing body of literature on defending against this side-channel attack-malicious IoT traffic analytics (TA), there's currently no systematic method to compare and evaluate the comprehensiveness of these existing studies. To address this problem, we design a new low-cost, open-source system framework-IoT Traffic Exposure Monitoring Toolkit (ITEMTK) that enables people to comprehensively examine and validate prior attack models and their defending approaches. In particular, we also design a novel image-based attack capable of inferring sensitive user information, even when users employ the most robust preventative measures in their smart homes. Researchers could leverage our new image-based attack to systematize and understand the existing literature on IoT traffic analysis attacks and preventing studies. Our results show that current defending approaches are not sufficient to protect IoT device user privacy. IoT devices are significantly vulnerable to our new image-based user privacy inference attacks, posing a grave threat to IoT device user privacy. We also highlight potential future improvements to enhance the defending approaches. ITEMTK's flexibility allows other researchers for easy expansion by integrating new TA attack models and prevention methods to benchmark their future work.}

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been increasingly deployed in smart homes for automation. Unfortunately, extensive recent research shows that external on-path adversaries can infer and fingerprint user sensitive in-home activities by analyzing IoT network traffic rates alone. Most recent traffic padding-based defending approaches cannot sufficiently protect user privacy with reasonable traffic overhead. In addition, these approaches typically assume the installation of additional hub hardware in smart homes to host their traffic padding-based defending approaches. To address these problems, we design a new open-source traffic reshaping system—privacy as a router operating system service (PAROS) that enables smart home users to significantly reduce private information leaked through IoT network traffic rates. PAROS does not assume the installation of any additional hardware device. We evaluate PAROS on open-source router Operating System (OS)—OpenWrt enabled virtual machine and also two real best-selling home routers. We find that PAROS can effectively prevent a wide range of state-of-the-art adversarial machine learning-based user in-home activity inference attacks, with near-zero system overhead increasing.},

  abstract={People have been increasingly deploying the Internet of Things (IoT) devices to monitor and control their environments. Unfortunately, extensive recent research has shown that IoT devices are vulnerable to multiple adversarial attacks, which analyze their network traffic to reveal a wide range of sensitive private information about user in-home activities. Thus, smart home users recently have a keen interest in employing virtual private networks (VPN) to obscure their privacy information in their IoT network traffic. Our key insight is that VPN-encrypted IoT network traffic data is not anonymous, since this aggregate traffic data can still be disaggregated into individual IoT device traffic data. And this individual IoT device traffic may have an identifiable traffic signature that already embeds detailed user sensitive information. To explore the severity and extent of this privacy threat, we design a new factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM)-based smart home network traffic disaggregator-TrafficSpy that can accurately disaggregate VPN-encrypted whole-house IoT network traffic data into individual IoT device network traffic data. We evaluate TrafficSpy using VPN network traffic data from three smart homes. We find that TrafficSpy can disaggregate VPN traffic data into individual IoT device data accurately. We also show that the disaggregated traffic traces can be further attacked by smart and adaptive adversaries and thus reveal user sensitive information. TrafficSpy represents a serious privacy threat, but also a potentially useful tool that provides important contextual information for smart home monitoring and automation.}

However, homeowners may have to spend up to ∼$375 to diagnose their damaged rooftop solar PV system. Thus, recently, there is a rising interest to inspect potential damage on solar PV arrays automatically and passively. Unfortunately, recent approaches that leverage machine learning techniques have the limitation of distinguishing solar PV array damages from other solar degradation (e.g., shading, dust, snow). To address this problem, we design a new system—SolarDiagnostics that can automatically detect and profile damages on rooftop solar PV arrays using their rooftop images with a lower cost. In essence, SolarDiagnostics first leverages an K-Means algorithm to isolate rooftop objects to extract solar panel residing contours. Then, SolarDiagnostics employs a convolutional neural networks to accurately identify and characterize the damage on each solar panel residing contour. We evaluate SolarDiagnostics by building a lower cost prototype and using 60,000 damaged solar PV array images generated by deep convolutional generative adversarial networks. We find that SolarDiagnostics is able to detect damaged solar PV arrays with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 1.0. In addition, pre-trained SolarDiagnostics yields an MCC of 0.95, which is significantly better than other re-trained machine learning-based approaches and yields as the similar MCC as of re-trained SolarDiagnostics. We make the source code and datasets that we use to build and evaluate SolarDiagnostics publicly-available.}

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has been erupting the world widely over the decade. Smart home and smart building owners are increasingly deploying IoT devices to monitor and control their environments due to the rapid decline in the price of IoT devices. The recent intensive research has shown that network traffic traces of IoT devices have significant cybersecurity and privacy issues. These security and privacy defending techniques have enabled sophisticated approaches to ensure security and preserve user privacy. However, due to the fact that different approaches are evaluated using their own datasets, their own developed security and privacy attack models, and their own evaluating metrics, it is being significantly difficult to make a fair and comprehensive comparisons among different IoT security strengthening and user privacy preserving research to better understand IoT security issues and end-user benefits. To address this problem, we present a deep learning-based adversarial attack model framework-SmartAttack, which enables a set of sophisticated adversarial attack models that can be leveraged by researchers and industrial users from IoT security community to better evaluate their work. In essence, we leverage the most widely used unsupervised machine learning and deep learning models to design and implement these attack models. SmartAttack also provides user options to select the detailed configuration for each attack model, such as kernel, dataset splitting, cross-validation states, and evaluating metrics. We also evaluate the performance of SmartAttack using two different datasets. In addition, we made the source codes and the related datasets of SmartAttack publicly-available on our research website such that researchers can use our SmartAttack to benchmark their security strengthening and privacy-preserving approaches.}
